      Homestead Puppies — Full-Stack System Showcase
    </h1>

    <p class="lead mb-3">
      If you’re only interested in the technical architecture, feel free to skip
      to the TL;DR stack summary below.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-4">
      This project is personally meaningful to me. It started as a small website
      for my dad’s retirement puppy breeding business — something simple to list
      available puppies. It quickly grew into something much larger and
      ultimately became the operational center of the business. Along the way,
      it also became my first true full-stack production system and my largest
      early Node.js project.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-4">
      What began as “just a website” evolved into a complete application:
      authentication, admin workflows, relational data modeling, media
      pipelines, deployment automation, infrastructure hardening, and long-term
      unattended operation. The system ran in production for over a year with
      non-technical users managing everything through the admin panel without
      needing code access.

      The admin interface remains fully functional, so public credentials are
      not exposed. If a technical reviewer needs to explore the system, I can
      provide temporary demonstration access.
